# Artsi

The visual arts are diverse and require varying approaches to learning them. For someone looking to learn drawing or a new medium, theyâ€™d have to scour the internet for likely expensive classes with long commutes. There are various tutorials online that teach all mediums of art but there are just too many with no definitive way and the videos lack the personalization that interaction with teachers brings.


The purpose of this project is to create an easy entry point into the creation of drawings by providing lesson videos and a drawing spaces that allows users to follow along.
